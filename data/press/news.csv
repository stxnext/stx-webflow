The solution acts as an autonomous AI developer, project manager or QA engineer, handling tasks with high levels of complexity all the way to deployment.<br><br>Commenting on the launch of DeepNext, Bartek Roszak, Head of AI at STX Next, said: “STX Next has embraced its heritage as a Python powerhouse to architect a groundbreaking AI solution. DeepNext represents a groundbreaking shift in AI, moving the paradigm from AI as a support mechanism for human tasks to a collaborative framework where humans take on a supervisory role.<br><br>“DeepNext covers all aspects of software development, providing intelligent and intuitive back-end solutions that deliver strong functionality. One of its main assets is its reliability, as the virtual developers code with precision and testers ensure seamless functionality.<br><br>“The system turns the developer into an AI operator and supervisor, enabling DeepNext to function independently. As a result, the human element in the process is focused on overseeing and monitoring the virtual developer’s performance, as opposed to directly getting involved in the technical process. We plan to equip our own development teams with virtual developers or AI agents, building another layer of reliability and accuracy into all the work that we do.<br><br>“DeepNext can be applied to any industry and project type. If correctly deployed, DeepNext can improve a company’s development speed by up to ten times.”<br><br>Roszak concluded: “We’re proud to celebrate our ethos and legacy as a technological leader and innovator with the launch of DeepNext.

Despite this growth in popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML, further growth could be limited without investment in specialised technical teams to drive integration.<br>&nbsp;<br>Despite AI and ML’s undoubted popularity, the survey also revealed that 50% of CTOs do not have a single member of staff employed in an AI, ML or data science role at present, with 41% of technical leaders saying that their business hadn’t implemented any AI technologies at all. This underlines the scale of the progress that still needs to be made.<br>&nbsp;<br>The findings were taken from STX Next’s 2023 Global CTO Survey, which surveyed 500 global CTOs about the biggest challenges facing their organisation. Other key findings from the research included:</p> 
                  <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br>The most common AI solution within businesses at present is image detection/segmentation with 23%, followed by recommendation systems at 20% and optical character or text recognition at 19%.</p> 
                  <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br>24% of companies have now implemented natural language processing at their business and 22% say that they’ve implemented deep learning.</p> 
                  <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br>Despite AI’s rapid growth, just a quarter of companies have a separate AI/Data division and 38% have between just one and five team members in a dedicated AI/ML or data science role.</p> 
                  <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br>Bartek Roszak, Head of AI at STX Next said: “AI’s popularity this year has been driven largely by the success of large language models like ChatGPT. However, AI has many use cases beyond models like these and can support many business functions. In 2024, we hope to see an increase in uptake of AI and ML in other business processes.</p> 
                  <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br>“That said, the existing applications of AI that the survey uncovered are largely unsurprising, as AI’s ability to tackle repetitive processes and recognise patterns within images and text is clear and evident to those working in technical roles. What is surprising is that these are still only adopted by a quarter of businesses. AI can and will revolutionise many industries, but there is still work to be done in educating the market on its capabilities.</p> 
                  <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br>“Our survey results have also revealed that while many leaders acknowledge AI’s potential, there is still a need for more investment in specialised resources to support its development. Implementing machine learning in one form or another will soon be crucial in keeping pace with changes in the industry and meeting customer expectations.&nbsp;</p> 
                  <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br>“This will no doubt become more prominent over the next year and beyond as organisations look for more ways to economically and efficiently scale their business and tackle new challenges. In many cases, leaders will need to assess the extent to which off-the-shelf ML solutions can support their businesses, and work out how much they need to invest in R&amp;D to deliver the required level of expertise.</p> 
                  <p style=""text-align: justify;""><br>“AI and ML’s popularity shows no &nbsp;sign of slowing over the coming twelve months. CTOs should embrace it’s potential, balancing the needs of the business with the unique needs of clients and customers. Those that are able to leverage its potential by enhancing their skillsets will reap the rewards in 2024.”</p>","Machine Learning’s popularity looks set to continue with 66% of CTOs predicting it will become much more prominent at their business in the next two to four years"

                  <br>

                  <br>The findings were taken from STX Next’s 2023 Python Tech Radar report, which collected insights from a range of Python developers. Other key figures include:

Updates to other areas such as performance and security are always crucial, but making it easier to carry out AI-related projects has to be a priority from now on as well.”<br><br>Binkofski concluded: “On a more general level, it’s also vital that developers are given the training they need to deepen their AI and ML skills, outside of the programming process itself. If organisations emphasise holistic training for their employees in this area – covering<br>everything from wider AI-related concepts, all the way through to the intricacies of coding for AI – they will set themselves up for a successful future.”</p>","Poznań, May 27, 2023"

This is according to<a href=""../../../../com/stxnext/www/index.html""><span> </span><span style=""color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;"">STX Next</span></a>, Europe’s largest software development company that specialises in Python.</p> 
                  <p>Alongside economic struggles, talent shortages are continuing to expose skills gaps in technical teams –<a href=""https://www.nashsquared.com/dlr-2022""><span> </span><span style=""color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;"">68% of tech companies</span></a> say they are held back by a lack of qualified staff – while decision-makers are still struggling to fine-tune remote working models and implement new technologies in the workplace. However, Maciej Dziergwa, CEO of STX Next, believes that tech companies can survive and thrive by adapting practices to reflect the business landscape.</p> 
                  <p>Dziergwa said: “It’s important that tech leaders recognise the current economic slowdown is halting the IT industry’s momentum, and react accordingly. For instance, they shouldn’t be afraid to rein in growth plans during the height of the crisis, allowing for flexibility if the climate suddenly worsens.</p> 
                  <p>“Downsizing is a concerning trend in the tech industry ­– Amazon, Meta and Twitter are the latest high profile organisations to slash employee numbers – so it is vital that businesses grow sustainably to avoid turning to job cuts.</p> 
                  <p>“Technology leaders should also prioritise the investment of time and funds into client acquisition and retention. This involves adopting a more client-focused approach, such as travelling to meet existing or potential partners face to face. Regular contact shows a business will be far more dependable during an economic slowdown than less visible competitors.”</p> 
                  <p>To cope with the shortage of IT workers, Dziergwa believes that technology companies should seek to enhance the employee experience in order to set themselves apart from competitors.</p> 
                  <p>He added: “With skills shortages putting a strain on recruitment strategies, it’s time for business decision-makers to be more proactive to attract new talent or retain incumbent employees.</p> 
                  <p>“Flexibility is a priority for the bulk of today’s workforce, so appealing to candidates begins by ensuring that remote working models are watertight, and that staff are well-supported even if they are based at home.</p>
